# Java JNI Starter Template

A Demo Java JNI API example to use as a starting point for Java Native Interface projects.

For those of you who don't know it, JNI is a bridge between JVM and native machine code instructions (this ScratchJNI uses a C binary).

To compile and run under Linux (you need gcc & JDK installed correctly), use the simple Makefile provided doing:

```
make
make run
```

The output'll be something like that:

```

Hello World (https://gianlu.dev/) 14!
The response from C is: I'm the C boss!

```
